# Getting started with scalable web application on Kubernetes

This lab walks you through how to scaffold a web application, run it locally in a container, and then deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster running in the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Additionally, you will learn how to bind a domain, monitor the health of the environment, and scale the application.
