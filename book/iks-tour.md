# IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service

IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service delivers powerful tools by combining Docker containers, the Kubernetes technology, an intuitive user experience, and built-in security and isolation to automate the deployment, operation, scaling, and monitoring of containerized apps in a cluster of compute hosts.

**For this tutorial, a Kubernetes cluster has been pre-created and assigned to you. This cluster is a paid standard cluster with one worker node** and come with the following characteristics:

* In-cluster networking
* Public network app access by a NodePort service to a non-stable IP address
* User access management
* IBM Cloud service access from the cluster and apps
* Disk space on worker node for non-persistent storage
* Ability to create cluster in every Kubernetes Service region
* Multizone clusters to increase app high availability
* Replicated masters for higher availability (Kubernetes 1.10 or later)
* Scalable number of worker nodes to increase capacity
* Persistent NFS file-based storage with volumes
* Public or private network app access by a load balancer service to a stable IP address
* Public network app access by an Ingress service to a stable IP address and customizable URL
* Portable public IP addresses
* Logging and monitoring
* Option to provision your worker nodes on physical (bare metal) servers
* Option to provision bare metal workers with Trusted Compute
