# Run the application locally

1. Run the container.
   ```sh
   ibmcloud dev run --trace
   ```
   This uses your local Docker engine to run the docker image that you built in the previous step.
2. After your container starts, go to http://localhost:9080/ for Java or http://localhost:3000/ for Node.
